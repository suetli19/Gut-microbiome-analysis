Workflow of microbiome analysis using shotgun sequencing data. 
This script shows an example of the standard workflow for microbiome analysis: 
1. Shannon diversity
2. PCoA plot
3. PERMANOVA
4. Differential abundant analysis (e.g. Maaslin2)

In this example, the samples were sequenced using shotgun metagenomics sequencing and the raw sequence data are then processed using BioBakery workflows. MetaPhlAn were used for taxa annotation and HUMAnN for functional pathway annotation.
